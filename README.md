Introduction to HTML
•	An HTML file contains a document type declaration, a head, a body, and elements. Elements are comprised of opening and closing tags.
•	Most modern web browsers support HTML5. Some of which are  Opera, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
•	HTML5 is a cleaner way to write HTML and it is a part of modern web development. 
•	Examples of some semantic elements include the header element, the nav element and the footer element. Non-semantic elements include the div element,  the logical division and the span element.
•	 HTML5 supports new elements, new attributes, full CSS3 support, video and audio, 2D and 3D graphics, local 
storage, local SQL databases, and web applications.
•	With HTML5, drawing graphics is simplified with new elements like the Canvas selector, inline SVG, and the use of CSS3 2D and 3D transforms.
•	To start developing in HTML5, there is a need for a browser that supports HTML5, so it is imperative to download Google's Chrome browser.
•	Komodo Edit, a free HTML editing software can be downloaded from Google Chrome while setting up its environment.
Block level and inline elements
•	The block-level element allows any content directly following the block-level element to be rendered on a new line.
•	The line break is used to create a new line in HTML. The line break is like the horizontal rule in the way that it doesn't have a closing tag.
•	Inline elements are different from the block-level elements group. Inline elements do not affect the surrounding content in the same way that the block-level elements do in HTML. 
•	The anchor element in HTML allows us to link to other web pages or websites. This element is denoted by the opening and closing A tags.
•	To create an easy way for viewers or readers to navigate back to the top of the page after they've read some number of texts on a web page, you can create a go back to the top link using the Komodo Edit.
•	Using images in HTML is very important. The image element is used to render images on a webpage. 
•	You can also use the relative file paths, measuring the width and height attributes as well as the alternate text attribute of the image element.
